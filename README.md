# Tic Tac Toe

## Description

This game is a virtual implementation of the classic and fun tic-tac-toe game.

## RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

- In this version, both you and your friend can choose whatever symbols you want. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

- In this virtual implementation, you and your friend can place a mark by selecting from a representation of rows and columns, from number 1 to 3, like in that example:
(rowcolumn)
(11)

| (11) | (12) | (13) |
-------------------
| (21) | (22) | (23) |
-------------------
| (31) | (32) | (33) |
-------------------

A winning position would like the image below at the end. As soon as someone gets three of their marks in a row, the game ends.

|  O  |  X  |  O  | 
-------------------
|  X  |  X  |  X  |  --- *Player 'X' wins with this row!*
-------------------
|  O  |  O  |  O  |
-------------------
